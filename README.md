# Return-Dynamics-of-ASELSAN-under-Global-and-Sovereign-Risk-Factors
This project studies the predictability of ASELSAN stock returns using a multivariate ARX framework and modern machine learning models. It combines macro-financial variables, robustness checks, and strict out-of-sample forecasting (2025–2026) to compare linear econometric models with Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
